Background: Why Tau-bench Matters

Tau-bench (ICLR 2025) evaluates AI agents in realistic environments — with APIs, domain rules, and interactive user sessions.
The key insight from the authors was unsettling:

Models that look good on average can become wildly unstable when run repeatedly.

To capture this instability, they proposed a new metric called pass^k,
which measures the probability that an agent never fails across k consecutive runs — a direct measure of reliability, not just average performance.

This article explains what pass^k really measures, why it differs fundamentally from pass@k,
and how even simple discrete examples reveal its importance — no Bayesian priors, no Beta assumptions required.

A Thought Experiment: The Coin and the Million-Dollar Game

Imagine the following game:

You win $1 million if you flip a coin and get 10 heads in a row.

You can choose one of two types of coins:
	1.	A fair coin (50% heads each toss).
	2.	A bag of two biased coins: one always heads, one always tails.
You draw one coin at random and use it for all 10 flips.

Both options have the same average success probability per toss: 0.5.
But the chance of 10 consecutive heads is drastically different:
	•	Fair coin: $(1/2)^{10}$ = 1/1024
	•	Mixed coins: 1/2

In other words:

Same average success (0.5), but “continuous success” differs by 500×.

That’s exactly what pass^k captures — the difference between occasional luck and consistent reliability.

Defining the Metrics — Same k, Different Questions

Let each task i have a single-run success probability $p_i \in [0,1]$.
Across tasks, these probabilities follow some distribution P(p).

Metric	Definition	Intuition
Average success rate	$\mathrm{pass}^1 = \mathbb{E}[p]$	“How often does it succeed once?”
Continuous success (pass^k)	$\mathrm{pass}^k = \mathbb{E}[p^k]$	“How often does it succeed *k times in a row?”
Coverage (pass@k)	$\mathrm{pass}@k = \mathbb{E}[1 - (1-p)^k]$	“If we try *k times, do we succeed at least once?”

So:
	•	pass@k → “How many retries until we get something right?”
	•	pass^k → “Can we avoid failure entirely for *k runs?”

Different questions. Different worlds.

A Toy Experiment: Same Mean, Different Shapes

Let’s fix the average success rate at 0.5, but vary the shape of the per-task distribution.

Name	Probabilities p_i	Description
homogeneous	[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]	perfectly uniform
no skew	[0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8]	symmetric
negative skew	[0.07, 0.715, 0.715, 0.07, 0.715, 0.715]	many high-p tasks, few very low
positive skew	[0.93, 0.285, 0.285, 0.93, 0.285, 0.285]	many low-p tasks, few very high

1️⃣ k-sweep: comparing pass@k (dashed) vs pass^k (solid)

🖼️ [Insert Figure 1 — pass@k (dashed) and pass^k (solid) vs k]

Key takeaways
	•	pass@k saturates quickly.
For the homogeneous case, $\mathrm{pass}@8 \approx 0.996$.
Yet $\mathrm{pass}^8 = 0.5^8 \approx 0.004$.
→ “Hit at least once” vs. “never miss once” are orders of magnitude apart.
	•	pass^k is shape-sensitive:
	•	Positive skew → largest pass^k (few high-p tasks dominate via convexity).
	•	Negative skew → smallest pass^k (a thin low-p tail kills reliability).
	•	Homogeneous → drops smoothly as 0.5^k.
	•	Ranking can even invert: a distribution worse in pass@k may be better in pass^k.

2️⃣ Quantifying shape effect: Δₖ

Define
$$
\Delta_k = \mathrm{pass}^k - (\mathrm{pass}^1)^k
$$

— the “gain from heterogeneity”.

🖼️ [Insert Figure 2 — Δₖ for non-homogeneous distributions]
	•	For homogeneous → Δₖ = 0.
	•	For heterogeneous → Δₖ > 0: right-side mass or fat tails lift pass^k.
	•	Without any p = 1 mass, Δₖ peaks at moderate k then fades (as E[p^k] → 0).

⸻

Why This Happens — Jensen’s Inequality, Visually

The math is simple but deep.
For k ≥ 2, p^k is a convex function on [0,1], and always p^k ≤ p.
By Jensen’s inequality:

$$
(\mathbb{E}[p])^k \;\le\; \mathbb{E}[p^k] \;\le\; \mathbb{E}[p] = \mu
$$

Thus
$$
\Delta_k = \mathbb{E}[p^k] - \mu^k \ge 0
$$
— meaning heterogeneity (mass near p = 1) always boosts pass^k.

If we fix μ but vary shape, the theoretical upper bound is:

$$
\max \Delta_k = \mu - \mu^k
$$
achieved by a two-point distribution:
$$
P(p{=}1)=\mu,\; P(p{=}0)=1-\mu.
$$

Intuitively: A few “always-correct” cases lift reliability far more than they lift average success.

Practical Use: Lessons from Tau-bench

Use case	Metric	Question answered	Typical setting
Exploration	pass@k	“How many retries until we get one right?”	Idea generation, sampling, brainstorming
Reliability	pass^k	“How often do we avoid all failures?”	Production, user-facing systems, compliance pipelines

Consider an automated support agent that answers thousands of times a day.
One failure can violate SLA/SLO targets.
Here, pass^k is the relevant metric — not average accuracy.

Recommended reporting set
	1.	pass^1 (mean success rate) + confidence interval
	2.	pass^k curve across k (reliability curve)
	3.	Optionally pass@k and Δₖ for coverage comparison

Small k (2–4) suits dev-testing gates; larger k (4–8 +) suits production SLOs.

Minimal Reproducible Code

```python
import numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pss = np.array([
    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],                # homogeneous
    [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8],                # no skew
    [0.07, 0.715, 0.715, 0.07, 0.715, 0.715],      # negative skew
    [0.93, 0.285, 0.285, 0.93, 0.285, 0.285]       # positive skew
])
labels = ["homogeneous","no skew","negative skew","positive skew"]
ks = np.arange(1, 9)

def pass_at_k(ps,k):  return np.mean(1-(1-ps)**k)
def pass_hat_k(ps,k): return np.mean(ps**k)

at_curves  = [[pass_at_k(ps,k)  for k in ks] for ps in pss]
hat_curves = [[pass_hat_k(ps,k) for k in ks] for ps in pss]
delta_curves = [[h - (ps.mean()**k) for h,k in zip(hc, ks)]
                for ps,hc in zip(pss, hat_curves)]

# Figure 1: k-sweep
for (a,h),lab in zip(zip(at_curves,hat_curves), labels):
    plt.plot(ks, a, linestyle="--")
    plt.plot(ks, h, label=lab)
plt.xlabel("k (repeated runs)"); plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.ylim(0,1.02); plt.legend(ncol=2); plt.grid(True, linestyle=":", linewidth=0.7)
plt.title("pass@k (dashed) vs pass^k (solid)")
plt.show()

# Figure 2: Δ_k
for dc,lab in zip(delta_curves[1:], labels[1:]):   # skip homogeneous (always 0)
    plt.plot(ks, dc, label=lab)
plt.xlabel("k (repeated runs)"); plt.ylabel("Δ_k")
plt.title("Δ_k = pass^k − (pass^1)^k"); plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, linestyle=":", linewidth=0.7); plt.show()
```



Key Takeaways
	•	pass@k measures coverage; pass^k measures reliability.
	•	Even with identical means, distribution shape (skewness, tails, multimodality) can change pass^k by orders of magnitude.
	•	From Jensen’s inequality:

$$
(\mathbb{E}[p])^k \le \mathbb{E}[p^k] \le \mathbb{E}[p]
$$

and the theoretical maximum gain is $\mu - \mu^k$.
	•	As Tau-bench demonstrates:
Average performance is not enough — consistent success defines reliability.
